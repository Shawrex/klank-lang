## What's klank?
**klank** is an experimental **interpreted programming language based on python** I'm working on as an amusement project.
I'm trying to make it look fancy on github so I can use it professionally in my portfolio if it goes somewhere maybe?
However becareful on this projet, it's very much s**t

## What can klank do so far?
**klank, so far, can:**
* `Var`: Create primitve vars (Strings, Ints)
* `Print:`: You can print litteral Strings, Ints, Vars
* `Test:`: Run a test on two values (String, Ints, Vars) with the `:=` operator
* Primitive arithmetic operations: You can write anywhere at anytime an addition or subtraction of two ints to make one

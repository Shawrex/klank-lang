# klank-lang
 
## What's klank?
**klank** is an experimental **interpreted programming language based on python** I'm working on as an amusement project.
I'm trying to make it look fancy on github so I can use it professionally in my portfolio if it goes somewhere maybe?
However becareful on this projet, it's very much s**t

## What can klank do so far?
**klank, so far, can:**
* `var`: Create primitve vars (Strings, Ints, Booleans)
* `print:`: You can print litteral Strings and all types of `var`s in the console

##klank example?!
This is a demo of what klank looks like:
```klank
var test = true
print: test
var foo = "a string"
print: "Hello World!"
print: foo
var foo = 1234567890
print: foo
```

And it returns:
```
True
Hello World!
a string
1234567890
```
